## Assignment 1

Hello I am Avanikaben Jadav, but please call me Avani ...I have completed my Associates Degree in Elecronics Engineering fromTaylor Business Institute , Chicago. I have studied some basics of programming in my early career as well. I have always like to solve the puzzels and thats why i choose Mathematics as my major in graduation back in my country. Now I want to learn the computer since I believed that Computer language is also like a math puzzel but the only difference is you have to keep updating your equations every day as technology changes so rapidly. I have already knowledge about C++ and java so i want to chose something differnet. Since Python is basic langauge, i would liketo start with base and hence i have choosen the Python for my course.
