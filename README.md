## Assignment 1

Hello I am Avanikaben Jadav, but please call me Avani ...I have completed my Associates Degree in Elecronics Engineering fromTaylor Business Institute , Chicago. I have studied some basics of programming in my early career as well. I have always like to solve the puzzels and thats why i choose Mathematics as my major in graduation back in my country. Now I want to learn the computer since I believed that Computer language is also like a math puzzel but the only difference is you have to keep updating your equations every day as technology changes so rapidly. I have already knowledge about C++ and java so i want to chose something differnet. Since Python is basic langauge, i would liketo start with base and hence i have choosen the Python for my course.

## Assignment 2

Integrated Development Environment provides different tools to make the program easy to write and run. It includes text editor,  compiler, output viewer, linker, loader. This week I have tried online IDE Repl.it which is free also. This IDE supports many languages including Python, Java, C#, Ruby, HTML, CSS and many more. In IDE we can see coding is different in each language just to print "Hello world" each language has a series of codes. I want to be a web developer in java in this IDE can help me to understand and write a small program in java.

## Assignment 3
In the previous chapter, we have learned some basics rules and fundamentals about programming. In this chapter, we have started doing programming and learning about the identifier. The identifier is a name, which used in variable declaration. Variables are the identifier, that change the values during program execution and store the value also. Data type is the type of value which variable can hold. Some fundamental data types are integer, float, string and boolean. Integer can hold only whole numbers and float can hold decimal though this data type varies over the language for example java script does not have integer it always store every number of value in float. We have also learned about some basic mathematical operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication , division and mod.

## Assignment 4
The vast portion of this chapter describes about the different types of data types. Mathematical precedence follows in computer equations as well.  Typecasting is a feature to help convert data types into one another. There are two types of conversion, one is explicit and another is implicit. Implicit conversion can be done internally by the compiler, at the time of execution. To do explicit conversion we need to apply a casting function. There are three types of operation depending on number of operands, unary needs one operand, binary operations need two operands, most operations are binary. 

## Assignment 5
I have learned about the function in this chapter. Functions are the group of code that needs to execute in the program multiple times. This feature gives us the ability to use the same code at multiple places and reusability of executable code. In every programming, language function can be called in many ways such as sub-routine, macro, procedure, etc. Programming language C is function-based language, which means we can not run any C program without function. To avoid writing the same code at multiple places we use the function, this way we also save the memory and time as well. Function code is written once in memory and at the time of calling function, the compiler will move its control there and retrieve the answer. Main objects of function is 1) defining function (in this we decide the return type, logic, and parameters of function. 2) Calling function (where to use the function in main body of program) 3) declare a function (this is an optional phase, we declare function for compiler to know so it does not give any error).
