## Assignment 1

Hello I am Avanikaben Jadav, but please call me Avani ...I have completed my Associates Degree in Elecronics Engineering fromTaylor Business Institute , Chicago. I have studied some basics of programming in my early career as well. I have always like to solve the puzzels and thats why i choose Mathematics as my major in graduation back in my country. Now I want to learn the computer since I believed that Computer language is also like a math puzzel but the only difference is you have to keep updating your equations every day as technology changes so rapidly. I have already knowledge about C++ and java so i want to chose something differnet. Since Python is basic langauge, i would liketo start with base and hence i have choosen the Python for my course.

## Assignment 2

Integrated Development Environment provides different tools to make the program easy to write and run. It includes text editor,  compiler, output viewer, linker, loader. This week I have tried online IDE Repl.it which is free also. This IDE supports many languages including Python, Java, C#, Ruby, HTML, CSS and many more. In IDE we can see coding is different in each language just to print "Hello world" each language has a series of codes. I want to be a web developer in java in this IDE can help me to understand and write a small program in java.
